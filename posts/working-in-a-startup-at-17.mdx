## Who Am I?

Hello everyone! My name is Leonardo Trapani, and I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself with you.

I'm 17 years old, currently a student at a science-oriented high school in Italy. I'm about to embark on my senior year as an exchange student in Vancouver, BC.

Why should you keep reading? Perhaps our stories might resonate with each other, and I'm here to explore that connection.

Since June 2023, I've been on an exciting journey with Datapizza. It's an Italian startup that emerged from a community of over 200,000 data and software enthusiasts. Our mission is to revolutionize the world of work.

At Datapizza, I work as a front-end developer. My role focuses on maintaining and creating new features for the platform [datapizza.tech](https://jobs.datapizza.tech).

## The Decision and Its Motivation

A question I often encounter, whether from family members or new acquaintances, is:

_"Why aren't you enjoying life like other teenagers?"_

_"Why aren't you savoring your youthful days?"_

_"Why are you doing this?"_

The seemingly straightforward answer is: "for my future." However, that's not the sole reason. I'm not sacrificing my present for the future. I want to clarify that. I'm doing this because it brings me joy.

I find happiness and satisfaction in self-improvement, leaving my comfort zone, accomplishing something significant, and avoiding the endless scroll of social media feeds.

## Navigating the Path

My journey into the world of programming began when I was young. Although I was always skilled, I didn't have a deep passion for it until the second year of high school.

During quarantine, a significant portion of my day was dedicated to playing video games. I easily fell into habits, and gaming had become one of them. Countless hours were spent chasing higher ranks.

That's why I convinced my father to buy me a MacBookâ€”a computer where playing video games would be really hard. Consequently, I had to find ways to fill my days. I started with the gym, but it wasn't enough.

I felt the need for something that would engage my mind and potentially aid me in the future. This is how I rekindled my interest in programming. It became an obsession, in a positive way, of course.

The free time I used to spend on my phone was redirected to programming, learning, and consuming programming content. It was during this time that I came across Datapizza through their podcast: "Algoritmi" ("algorithms").

On April 17, 2023, the platform [datapizza.tech](https://jobs.datapizza.tech) was launched. It featured job listings. This is how I stumbled upon an opportunity while casually browsing through job listings. By chance, I clicked the "interested" button.

Doubts clouded my mind, and I was convinced that no one would take me seriously. I thought I would attend the interview only to be dismissed after five minutes. Despite these reservations, I went ahead.

As Richard Templar once said, "[it's] better to jump and make a mistake than sit there too frightened to make a move."

Two days later, after a long school day, I was ready to head home and study for the philosophy test scheduled for the next day. I opened my phone and noticed a notification. I was asked to attend an in-person interview that afternoon. Plato could wait.

Shortly after, I received the good news: I had been hired. That's when I realized I was about to have a splendid summer.

## Progress and Experience

And splendid it was. I found myself facing a lot of responsibilities, maintaining the frontend platform by myself. I built many new features, like the new Landing Page and the new Onboarding.

I learned new technologies and improved on the technologies I already knew. I participated in events and understood how an actual startup works.

Not only did I enjoy what I was doing, but the environment I found myself in was surreal. From day one, I felt at home. The age gap was never an issue; they treated me as one of their own.

Whether you're 17, 30, or 50, there's a mindset that renders age irrelevant. Working in a startup embodies this. It's about being part of an environment that encourages you to do more, where your colleagues become your best friends.

You wake up in the morning and say, "What a great day for work," and you eagerly await Mondays during weekends.

Between team retreats, work, concerts, sports, and friendships, I will forever be grateful to Datapizza for gifting me with such wonderful months.
