Last year, I got hired as a seventeen-year-old software developer at Datapizza, a startup that is the largest community in Italy for data tech, AI, computer science, and programming, with over 400,000 followers across platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram. Here's how it happened.

If you speak Italian and you prefer a video format, I talk this experience on my youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdizHWvB5m0)

## Who is Datapizza and What Do They Do

Datapizza is divided into four main parts:

- **Community**: The most well-known part, with nearly 200,000 followers on Instagram and 120,000 on LinkedIn, as well as many other platforms like Discord. They provide educational content on AI and computer science through reels and carousels on any new developments in AI and IT.
- **Education**: They offer education on AI and new updates in schools, universities, and companies.
- **AI Team**: They focus on research and development of AI-based products.
- **Jobs**: My area of work, where we help our community find suitable job opportunities through partnerships with large companies like Intesa San Paolo.

## How I Discovered Them

I started programming at a young age. Following my passion, I listened to podcasts and watched videos on Instagram and YouTube, where I discovered Datapizza. When I learned they were launching the Jobs platform, I decided to contact the founder Pierpaolo, asking for an opportunity. I was 16 years old but wanted to prove my skills.

## The Hiring Process

The process began with an introductory interview with Pierpaolo, where I demonstrated my skills and seriousness. Then, I received a technical test, which I completed successfully and ahead of time. After confirming my abilities through additional interviews, they asked me to visit their offices in Milan.

## My First Day at Datapizza

When I arrived on my first day, I was amazed by the environment. Contrary to the traditional view of work being tiring and something you look forward to ending on Fridays, I found myself eager to return the next day after just five minutes of conversation. That afternoon, instead of working much, we spent time discussing life, technology, and AI. ChatGPT was still in its early stages, and we debated whether it would be useful. A funny detail that has since become a company meme is when they asked me to go for an aperitivo, but I declined because I had a philosophy exam on Plato the next day.

## My Role at Datapizza

A few weeks after this initial interaction, I started working at Datapizza during the summer. The company was still in its early stages, and the frontend developer was leaving, while a backend developer had just joined. I found myself responsible for maintaining the entire frontend almost alone, with some support from another developer who worked at JP Morgan in London and couldn't dedicate full-time hours. During that summer, I exceeded expectations by building a landing page, which is still live at [datapizza.tech](https://jobs.datapizza.tech), and developing features like an AI-assisted resume upload tool. But more on my internship in [this blog post](/blog/working-in-a-startup-at-17).

## My Year Abroad in Vancouver

After this internship, I left for a year abroad in Vancouver. During this year, I focused more on personal growth and making friends rather than working full-time. However, I returned to Datapizza three weeks ago, jumping right back into work.

## What I'm Doing Now

Now, I'm working as a software developer in a much more structured team. More on that on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@leotrapani).

## Key Takeaways for Getting Hired at a Startup at a Young Age

- **Technical Skills**: At a young age, it's crucial to be very good at technical skills. No one will trust you easily with an empty resume. Study computer science, web applications, websites, mobile apps, and everything that interests you.
- **Demonstrate Your Skills**: Showcase your work online, for example, through GitHub, and include links to your applications in your application emails. This allows others to validate your skills.
- **Take Risks**: Don't be afraid to try. Often, opportunities are just around the corner. Send emails, contact people, and seize every chance to prove your value. I hesitated for two days before sending that email to Pierpaolo, but in the end, what did I have to lose? Just 20 minutes of my time.

Luck also plays a role, but you create your own luck by staying alert to opportunities and being proactive. If you liked the video, subscribe and comment if you have any specific topics or advice for me. Thanks for listening, and see you next time!
