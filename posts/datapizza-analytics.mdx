## Introduction

At Datapizza, we believe that analytics should serve as the foundation for every business and startup. While assumptions about customer needs can guide early product development, it is crucial to understand what customers **really** want. As Eric Ries aptly puts it in *The Lean Startup*:

> We must learn what customers really want, not what they say they want or what we think they should want.

To make this a reality, we have optimized every aspect of our data strategy at Datapizza. In this post, we’ll delve into how we collect data, why we chose to move away from client-side analytics, and how we implemented a robust server-side analytics solution.

## How We Collect Data at Datapizza

Our approach to data at Datapizza is simple: data-driven decisions guide everything we do. This means that understanding user behavior and collecting accurate data are critical for delivering products that truly meet our customers’ needs.

## Common Pitfalls in Data Analytics Implementation

Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of data, many businesses implement analytics incorrectly by using client-side analytics exclusively. Client-side analytics involves sending data directly from the browser to an analytics provider, such as Mixpanel, Google Tag Manager, or PostHog. Unfortunately, this approach has significant limitations.

## The Challenge of Ad Blockers in Analytics

One major problem with client-side analytics is the prevalence of ad blockers. According to [Statista's Digital 2024 Global Overview Report](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2024-global-overview-report), nearly 1 billion people use ad blockers or JavaScript blockers. These tools recognize requests to analytics providers and block them, resulting in incomplete or inconsistent data. Given that Datapizza’s recruiting platform attracts tech-savvy users who are more likely to use ad blockers, this posed a major issue for us.

## Addressing the Ad Blocker Problem

To overcome this challenge, we explored various solutions. One option is using a proxy-based service like [Data Unlocker](https://www.dataunlocker.com/). Data Unlocker modifies requests to bypass filtering lists and ensures analytics data is transmitted more effectively.
![How do data unlockers work](/images/importanceofanalytics/dataunlocker.png)

### How Data Unlocker Works
- Encodes and decodes client request and response data to bypass filtering lists.
- Detects and mitigates content blocker intrusion.
- Recovers stubbed resources (blocked or altered resources).
- Proxies client requests to ensure they are properly routed to analytics servers.
- Continuously monitors web applications and content filtering lists.

### Pros and Cons of Using Data Unlocker

#### Pros
- Easy to implement
- Achieves relatively good results

#### Cons
- High cost over time
- Dependence on a third-party service for data handling
- Limited control over data
- Increasing sophistication of ad blockers may limit effectiveness
- Some data may still be blocked

## Why We Opted for Server-Side Analytics

To gain more control and consistency in our analytics, we decided to move to server-side analytics. This approach involves sending data to our own servers before forwarding it to analytics providers.

### Advantages of Server-Side Analytics
- **Higher data accuracy and consistency**: Ad blockers do not block requests made to our own servers.
- **Enhanced control**: We maintain full control over the data collected and processed.
- **No third-party dependencies**: Our data remains in our hands, ensuring better data security and privacy.
- **Improved data privacy**: Server-side analytics keeps sensitive user information on our servers, reducing the risk of exposure to third-party services.
- **Faster page load times**: Offloading analytics to the server reduces the amount of JavaScript loaded on the client side, improving page speed and user experience.
- **Enhanced data security**: Data is processed on our secure servers, minimizing the risk of data breaches or interception during transmission.
- **Better cross-domain tracking**: Server-side tracking enables us to manage cookies and identifiers centrally, providing more accurate tracking of users across multiple domains.
- **Consistent tracking across devices**: Server-side analytics improves cross-device tracking by linking data through server identifiers, avoiding the inconsistencies often found in client-side tracking.

### Potential Challenges of Server-Side Analytics
- **Increased server traffic**: Passing all tracking functions through our servers can potentially slow down performance and increase costs. We still have not observed any major costs or slowdowns, but this might be thanks to a good and optimized hosting infrastructure.
- **Complexity**: Server-side analytics can be challenging and time-consuming to implement correctly.

## Implementing Server-Side Analytics
The key issues that are present with Server-Side Analytics are:
- User Identification
- User Informations, such as Browser, UTMs,

Here is how we handle it:

It all starts on the frontend, where we simply make a post request to our servers every time we want to track something, including all cookies and headers.

```javascript
export const trackServerAnalytics = (trackData: {
  data: any;
  event_name: string;
  event_id: string;
  //more properties based on what has to be tracked
}) => {
  return axios.post(
    backendBaseUrl + "/track_analytics/",
    {
      ...trackData,
    },
    {
      withCredentials: true,
    }
  );
};
```

### Example: Backend Integration for Mixpanel

We integrated server-side analytics on our Django backend servers, to implement server-side analytics for Mixpanel. Similar implementations can be adapted for other analytics providers and backend frameworks. Take the following as an example to understand the necessary steps and difficulties when implementing it.

### Handling User Information and UTM Sources

To ensure we capture accurate data, we handle user information and UTM sources on the server. This data, typically managed by client-side SDKs, is essential for optimizing our analytics.

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs

# rest of the code (django routes, imports, data serialization...)

parsed = parse_user_agent(request.headers.get("User-Agent", ""))
mixpanel_properties.update({
    "$browser": parsed["user_agent"]["family"],
    "$device": parsed["device"]["family"],
    "$os": parsed["os"]["family"],
    "$current_url": mixpanel_properties.get("action_source_url"),
})

mixpanel_properties["ip"] = request.META.get("REMOTE_ADDR")

if "Referer" in request.headers:
  url_parsed = urlparse(request.headers["Referer"])
  mixpanel_properties.update({
      "$referrer": request.headers["Referer"],
      "$referring_domain": url_parsed.hostname,
      })
  query_params = parse_qs(url_parsed.query)
    utm_keys = ["utm_source", "utm_medium", "utm_campaign", "utm_content", "utm_term"]
    utm_values = {key: query_params[key][0] for key in utm_keys if query_params.get(key)}
  mixpanel_properties.update(utm_values)
  ```

### User Identification in Server-Side Analytics

Mixpanel groups actions by user sessions. By passing a `user_id` property, we can track user events accurately. To handle unauthenticated users and track the entire user session when he authenticates, we also use a `device_id` generated on the frontend.

```javascript
const setIdentifierCookieIfNotSet = (isDev) => {
  let deviceId = getCookie("device_id");
  if (!deviceId) {
    deviceId = generateUniqueId();
    setCookie("device_id", deviceId, 365);
  }
  return deviceId;
};
```
Here are the utility functions used in setIdentifierCookieIfNotSet, if interested:
```javascript
function generateUniqueId(): string {
  return "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx".replace(
    /[xy]/g,
    function (c) {
      const r = (Math.random() * 16) | 0,
        v = c === "x" ? r : (r & 0x3) | 0x8;
      return v.toString(16);
    }
  );
}

function getCookie(name: string): string | undefined {
  const value = `; ${document.cookie}`;
  const parts = value.split(`; ${name}=`);
  if (parts.length === 2) return parts.pop()?.split(";").shift();
}

function setCookie(name: string, value: string, days: number): void {
  let expires = "";
  if (days) {
    const date = new Date();
    date.setTime(date.getTime() + days * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    expires = "; expires=" + date.toUTCString();
  }
  const isLocalhost = window.location.hostname === "localhost";
  const secureFlag = isLocalhost ? "" : "; Secure";
  const sameSiteFlag = "; SameSite=None"; // Required for cross-origin
  const domainFlag = "; domain=.datapizza.tech"; // Allow cookies to be shared across subdomains

  isDev
    ? (document.cookie = `${name}=${value || ""}; path=/`)
    : (document.cookie = `${name}=${
        value || ""
      }${expires}; path=/${sameSiteFlag}${secureFlag}${domainFlag}`);
}
```

On the backend, we then update the same dict we used previously and that we will pass to mixpanel.
```python
device_id = request.COOKIES.get("device_id")

if not device_id:
  raise NotAcceptable("Device ID is required")

mixpanel_properties.update({
  "$user_id": mixpanel_properties.get("uuid"),
  "$device_id": device_id,
})
```

Finally, we can then call the mixpanel sdk
```python
# Note: leave the first argument blank here, since we're passing $device_id and $user_id as mixpanel_roperties.
mp.track("", event_name, mixpanel_properties)
```

## Deduplication

For other analytics providers, such as Facebook Pixel (`fbq`), we combine client-side and server-side analytics to leverage the strengths of both. Deduplication is achieved by passing the same `event_id` to both client and server events, ensuring accurate data without duplication, and the same event showing twice.

## Summary of Our Analytics Strategy at Datapizza

By adopting a robust server-side analytics solution, Datapizza ensures data accuracy, consistency, and control. This allows us to make better-informed decisions, optimize our platform, and serve our users more effectively.

To implement an effective server-side analytics solution, it is important to still track utm sources, browser's informations, and user authentication.

## Conclusion

Analytics is at the core of our success at Datapizza. For startups looking to grow, a well-implemented analytics strategy is key to understanding customer needs and driving business and startup growth.
